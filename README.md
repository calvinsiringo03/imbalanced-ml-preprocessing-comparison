# imbalanced-ml-preprocessing-comparison
This repository provides a comparative analysis of data preprocessing methods, including Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), Clustering-Based Prototype Generation (CBP), and Random Oversampling (ROS), alongside advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM. The primary focus is on addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets and evaluating the performance of various preprocessing techniques in enhancing classification accuracy. Detailed experiments and evaluations using precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics are included to guide practitioners in selecting effective strategies for their imbalanced dataset problems.
